<p>As an instant download, you can literally be reading this one minute and then next be setup and producing right from your desk. If you’re serious about getting started, then you can jump right away into intense track producing as quickly as you can surf over to their site. dubturbo user interface Learning to use the software is a breeze, there are tons of videos and the easy to use menus won’t cause you to pull out your hair (unheard of for producing software). One of the main selling points though for this dubstep software? You don’t need turntables to use it, DJ equipment, or expensive wallet-breaking hardware to make dubstep. After heading over to the Dub Turbo site, you can tell right off the bat that they aren’t your average software company. They offer top notch graphics, videos, and information on their site. You can guess that the quality of the software will match the feel of the site. As you click the purchase option you are forwarded to a site known as Clickbank, a well-known and reputable company which sells a ton of other programs and software. As a previous customer of theirs in the past, I’ve come to know their name in the online world. They’ve been around for over 10 years so I had no problem purchasing from them again. As you complete your purchase you have an option of upgrading to a VIP package, which I opted to pick-up since I wanted a full array of features for my arsenal. There’s also a pretty legit bonus which guides you through selling your dubstep tracks if that’s something you want to get into (I know I did). The link they send you to download your purchase is fast and I was fully set up in just a few minutes. It really is that easy to do. You’ll immediately notice that the software is smooth and simple to navigate. After watching just a few videos, I actually had a track setup within 15 minutes of starting it. Mind you, I have a basic understanding of music production software, but Dub Turbo really is that easy. Another cool feature which I didn’t learn about until after reading up on their website is that you can access it both online and offline. So if you happen to be at a remote computer or friend’s place, you can hop on and create some dubstep anytime. Personally, I’ve never used the tech support at Dub Turbo, but a friend of mine has once or twice and noted that they have been quite helpful and responsive. Everything I’ve read in terms of reviews for their tech support all state that they handle their customers well. Hopefully this review gives you a great starting point for your new venture into producing dubstep. I honestly feel that Dub Turbo is the best dubstep software you can buy for your money right now. If you’re looking to getting into the scene and start smashing out new tracks then head over to Dub Turbo’s site. It’s worth far beyond what you pay for it and to be honest I wouldn’t be surprised if they doubled or tripled the price in the near future since they released version 2.0.</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">dubstepsoftware</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>

It’s worth far beyond what you pay for it and to be honest I wouldn’t be surprised if they doubled or tripled the price in the near future since they released version 2.0.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":true,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}}]},"site-footer-item":{"id":"site-footer-item","index":2,"metadata":{"@type":"footer","starred":true},"content":[{"id":"site-footer-block","type":"footer","_html":"","metadata":{"starred":true},"footer":{"rss":{"href":"rss.xml","rel":"alternate","title":"dubstepsoftware RSS","type":"application/rss+xml"}}}]}},"sections":[{"componentId":"ArticleFallback","itemsToRenderIds":["1011340c-d69f-47c6-b386-e7193e2a00e8"],"contracts":{"the-beautician":{"$item_index":1,"sectionsBeautyverse":{"section-height":{"$class":["section-height-fullscreen"]},"text-align":{"$class":["text-align-left"]},"group-order":{"$class":["group-order-normal"]},"group-graphical-shape":{"$class":["group-graphical-shape-none"]}},"$class":["group-graphical-shape-none","group-order-normal","text-align-left","section-height-fullscreen","site:w-multiple-item","hero-transition-none","section-v-padding-medium","section-h-padding-large","Bass","1011340c-d69f-47c6-b386-e7193e2a00e8","item:can-cover-filter","item:can-cover-crop","item:can-cover-overlay","item:w-cover-face","item:w-cover-saliency","item:w-cover-landscape","item:w-cover-medium-res","ArticleFallback"]},"the-colorist":{"$item_index":1,"colorverse":{"colors-solution":{"color":"black","$class":["colors-black"]},"colors-locality":{"locality":"global","$class":["colors-global"]}},"$class":["colors-global","colors-black","site:colors-global","site:colors-dark"],"colorsSolution":{"isLight":false,"isDark":true,"lightnessClass":"is-dark","base":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"bg":{"r":3,"g":3,"b":3},"box":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"boxShadow":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.3},"boxPop":{"r":162,"g":227,"b":196},"boxPopText":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"boxPop2":{"r":60,"g":73,"b":63},"boxPop2Text":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255},"boxPopTextHover":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"boxPop2TextHover":{"r":204,"g":204,"b":204},"boxPopMostVibrant":{"r":54,"g":226,"b":143},"boxPopMostVibrantText":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0},"selectionText":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255},"selection":{"r":12,"g":192,"b":54,"a":0.5},"header":{"r":1,"g":1,"b":1},"zebraStripe":{"r":4,"g":4,"b":4},"line":{"r":19,"g":19,"b":19},"mediaBorder":{"css":"1px solid hsl(0, 0%, 7%)","width":1,"type":"solid","color":{"r":19,"g":19,"b":19}},"mediaShadowColor":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.4},"mediaInsetColor":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255,"a":0.1},"mediaShadows":[{"css":"0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)","x":0,"y":1,"blur":2,"color":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.4},"inset":false},{"css":"inset 0 1px 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)","x":0,"y":1,"blur":1,"color":{"r":255,"g":255,"b":255,"a":0.1},"inset":true}],"title":{"r":222,"g":237,"b":231},"title2":{"r":155,"g":166,"b":162},"subTitle":{"r":73,"g":73,"b":73},"text":{"r":241,"g":244,"b":242},"text2":{"r":169,"g":171,"b":169},"textShadow":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.5},"textShadowProps":{"color":{"r":0,"g":0,"b":0,"a":0.5},"x":0,"y":1,"blur":0},"textPop":{"r":126,"g":141,"b":133},"textPop2":{"r":60,"g":73,"b":63},"meta":{"r":73,"g":73,"b":73},"metaHover":{"r":84,"g":84,"b":84},"icon":{"r":126,"g":141,"b":133},"iconSelected":{"r":126,"g":141,"b":133},"iconOver":{"r":126,"g":141,"b":133},"palette":[{"r":60,"g":73,"b":63},{"r":126,"g":141,"b":133},{"r":179,"g":191,"b":184},{"r":240,"g":247,"b":244},{"r":162,"g":227,"b":196}]}},"the-lensman":{"filter":{"$class":["passthrough"],"graph":"passthrough","config":null}},"itemsClasses":["1011340c-d69f-47c6-b386-e7193e2a00e8","item:can-cover-filter","item:can-cover-crop","item:can-cover-overlay","item:w-cover-face","item:w-cover-saliency","item:w-cover-landscape","item:w-cover-medium-res"],"siteClasses":["site:w-multiple-item","hero-transition-none","section-v-padding-medium","section-h-padding-large","Bass","site:colors-global","site:colors-dark"],"componentClasses":["ArticleFallback"]},"sectionIndex":0}],"contracts":{"the-typographer":{"typography":{"fonts":{"display":{"normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.09090909090909094,"$type":["sans","grotesque"],"$weight":2,"$width":2,"$contrast":2,"family":"Karla","name":"Karla","foundry":"google","license":"ofl","similar_to":["apercu","ll circular","maison","maple","reader","relative","supria sans"],"description":"Karla is an open-source, grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Jonathan Pinhorn.
