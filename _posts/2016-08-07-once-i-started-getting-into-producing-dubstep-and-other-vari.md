  Once I started getting into producing dubstep and other varieties of EDM
  (house, drum & bass, etc.) I stumbled upon this massively definitive program
  called Dub Turbo. This program is an all-star if you’re looking to take the
  same path that I have and create dubstep without a ton of music producing
  experience. I’ve been doing this for a little over a year now, but previously
  I had little to no experience in the industry. What sets Dub Turbo apart from
  other production programs and dubstep software is that it was created
  specifically for dubstep music. Now I’ve spent a number of hours testing other
  programs and created several tracks with some of the bigger names, but the end
  result was usually the same. They were either huge time wasters or they just
  couldn’t handle the quality of music I wanted to create. Time and time again
  this all-star dubstep software stood above the rest as the one which outshined
  the rest. Dubturbo dubstep softwareBack in January when I first discovered Dub
  Turbo, I was really looking for something without a huge price tag and could
  prove to have better quality than the competition. I needed to find something
  that wasn’t made to just produce simple loops, regardless if it was filthy and
  full of wobbles. What I found was that it was simple to create a complex and
  well-produced song in a very short amount of time. In fact, their website
  boasts that you can create a song in as little as 10 minutes. First of all,
  the most attractive attribute for Dub Turbo is simply the price tag. What you
  get for around $30 bucks is just downright impressive. Actual music production
  software for under $50 is almost unheard of. But to get something that is top
  shelf quality for that price with download capability and all the features you
  need is f#$&*ing ridiculous.
