Professional Mixing is crucial for the track to get ready for Mastering. And most of the dubstep producers are mixing their own tracks. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/49c8a671-3141-41d4-8f6e-703a1ef3c776.png)

There are two approaches for mixing:

1\. Mixing while producing - mix as you go

2\. Bouncing your production and making a new project for the mixing stage.
